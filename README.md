# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

Execute the python script to start the local webcam which will detect a face in the frame with a bounding box around it and name of the person.

Include the training images of any new person in the 'train' folder along with their name as the name of the image file itself to be able to recognize the face.

Whenever a new face is identified an unique entry is logged in the 'Attendance.csv' file along with the timestamp.
